# Three simulations have been designed here. The first simulation is that robot swarm tries to find one random selected box of n boxes in the warehouse. 
# The second simulation is that robot swarm try to find all n boxes in the warehouse. The last simulation is used to calculate the time robot swarm uses to scan the whole area.
# Main codes of three simulation are in area_coverage.py, find_all_object_can_pass_through_boxes.py, and find_one_object_can_pass_through_the_box.py.
